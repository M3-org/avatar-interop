# Avatar Interop Group

This meetup group is dedicated to avatar interoperability R&D spanning file formats, wearables, and animation systems. Our goal is to produce content and documentation while live field testing and to aid other open metaverse standards working groups.

## Get Involved

We meet weekly on Tuesdays at 1pm EST starting in the [M3 discord](https://discord.gg/m3org), you can add the event to your [calendar here](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MXI0djMydnBqMmIzMG9xY3JjN2U3cDBldGFfMjAyMjAzMTVUMTcwMDAwWiBmOWxzcmRnODI1aThpdmdpZm1qdHM4czRsb0Bn&tmsrc=f9lsrdg825i8ivgifmjts8s4lo%40group.calendar.google.com&scp=ALL).

As we're testing and making content with avatars during the week, our goal is to also provide useful feedback to a couple of other related working groups in OMI, mainly the [OMI scripting group](https://github.com/omigroup/omi-scripting-group) and the [OMI glTF-extensions group](https://github.com/omigroup/gltf-extensions).
